## The Principle Analysis of Frontend Monitoring SDK

A complete frontend monitoring platform consists of three parts: data collection and reporting, data processing and storage, and data visualization.

This article focuses on the first component - data collection and reporting. Below is an outline of the topics we'll cover:

Since theoretical knowledge alone can be difficult to grasp, I've created a simple [monitoring SDK](https://github.com/woai3c/monitor-demo) that implements these technical concepts. You can use it to create simple demos and gain a better understanding. Reading this article while experimenting with the SDK will provide the best learning experience.
